    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bang Bang Chicken is a flavorful Chinese-inspired dish made of shredded or sliced chicken served with a rich, creamy, and mildly spicy sauce. Traditionally, the sauce combines sesame paste, peanut butter, chili oil, soy sauce, and garlic, giving it a nutty, savory, and slightly sweet flavor with a gentle heat (“bang bang” refers to the sound of tenderizing the chicken with a wooden stick). It’s often served cold or at room temperature over noodles or fresh vegetables, making it both refreshing and satisfying.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
         <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
         <li>¼ cup potato starch</li>
         <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)</li>
         <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
         <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1 - Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; stir to coat and allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and discard egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Step 2 - Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium bowl. Pour into a large plastic resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the bag and shake until chicken is well coated.</li>
        <li>Step 3 - Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot oil for about 90 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each batch separate.</li>
        <li>Step 4 - Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds.</li>
        <li>Step 5 - Remove to another paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.</li>
        <li>Step 6 - Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a large serving bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Step 7 - Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
